# Python Basics Project

Task 0: Basic Print
Print exact text with quotes using escaped characters

Task 1: Integer Printing with f-string
Print variable number with text without explicit string casting

Task 2: Float Precision Formatting
Display float with exactly 2 decimal places using f-string formatting

Task 3: String Repetition and Slicing
Repeat string 3 times and extract first 9 characters

Task 4: String Concatenation
Combine variables to form "Welcome to Holberton School!"

Task 5: Advanced String Slicing
Extract first 3 letters, last 2 letters, and middle portion

Task 6: Complex String Reconstruction
Build new sentence from specific slices of a long string

Task 7: Python Easter Egg
Use import this to print "The Zen of Python"

Common Techniques Used:
String formatting: f-strings and .format()

String slicing: [:n], [-n:], [m:n]

String operations: concatenation (+), repetition (*)

Built-in features: import this Easter egg

Constraint adherence: exact line counts, no loops/conditionals

Key Learning Points:
Python string manipulation basics

Precision in following exact output requirements

Working within specific constraints

Using Python's concise syntax effectively
